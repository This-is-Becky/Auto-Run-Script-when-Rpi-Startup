# Auto Run-Script-when-Rpi-Startup
In **Raspberry Pi Linux** systems, **autoscripts** refer to custom scripts or programs that are automatically executed during system events, such as Startup. 

The tool used to control these scripts is `systemctl`, which allows users to define, enable, and manage services that run automatically. This is especially useful for automating tasks such as:
- Starting sensor monitoring or data logging scripts
- Start recording when Vehicle-mounted camera reboot
- Auto connect to WiFi when restart
